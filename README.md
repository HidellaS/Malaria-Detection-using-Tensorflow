## Malaria Detection using TensorFlow

This repository contains a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using TensorFlow for the detection of malaria parasites in blood smear images. The notebook covers the entire workflow, including:

Data Loading & Preprocessing: Steps to import and prepare the image dataset for training, including augmentation and normalization.

Model Architecture: Detailed construction of a CNN model tailored for image classification tasks.

Training & Evaluation: Compilation, training, and validation of the model with clear metrics to assess performance.

Visualization & Results: Graphs and metrics that showcase the training progress and final evaluation results.

This project is intended for researchers, data scientists, and machine learning enthusiasts interested in applying deep learning techniques to medical image analysis. Contributions and suggestions are welcome to further improve the model and its applications.
